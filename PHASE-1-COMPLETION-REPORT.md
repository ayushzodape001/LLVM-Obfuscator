## Technical Details

### Architecture Implemented

1. **PassManager Pattern** - Central orchestrator for all passes
2. **Config System** - JSON/CLI-based configuration
3. **Metrics Collection** - Foundation for obfuscation metrics
4. **Logging System** - Diagnostic logging capability
5. **Utility Library** - 10+ helper functions for common tasks

### Key Design Decisions

- **Opaque Pointers**: Using `void*` for LLVMModuleRef/LLVMFunctionRef to avoid requiring full C++ headers
- **Modular Architecture**: Each pass independent and pluggable
- **Registry Pattern**: PassManager dynamically loads enabled passes
- **C API Focus**: Using LLVM-C library from pre-built binary

### Libraries Generated

| Library | Type | Size | Purpose |
|---------|------|------|---------|
| ObfuscatorCore | Static | 45 KB | Configuration, logging, metrics |
| ObfuscatorAnalysis | Static | 28 KB | Code analysis utilities |
| ObfuscatorPasses | Dynamic | 474 KB | Obfuscation pass implementations |
