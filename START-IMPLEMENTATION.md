```powershell
cd build
cmake --build . --config Release
```

### Running Tests (when you write them)
```powershell
cd build
cmake --build . --config Release --target RUN_TESTS
```

### Checking Your Work
```powershell
# Verify it compiles
cd build
cmake --build . --config Release

# Should see:
# - 0 errors ‚úÖ
# - 0 warnings ‚úÖ
# - ObfuscatorPasses.dll generated ‚úÖ
```

## üìù Commit Message Format

Follow this format for clear history:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body - optional but recommended>

<footer - optional>
```

**Examples**:
```
feat(passes): implement findStrings method
feat(passes): implement XOR encryption logic
feat(passes): inject decryption stubs
test(passes): add unit tests for string encryption
fix(passes): handle empty string edge case
docs(passes): document string encryption algorithm
```

## üîë Key Files to Modify

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/passes/StringEncryption.cpp` | Main implementation |
| `include/obfuscator/Passes.h` | Already has base interface (READ FIRST) |
| `include/obfuscator/Config.h` | Configuration options |
| `include/obfuscator/Metrics.h` | Metrics collection |

---

## üí° Implementation Tips

### 1. Start with Understanding LLVM
- Review how global variables are represented in IR
- Understand how to iterate through Module's globals
- Learn how to insert new functions into IR

### 2. Work Incrementally
- Implement one piece at a time
- Test frequently
- Commit after each working piece
- Don't try to do everything at once

### 3. Use the Scaffold
- `StringEncryption.cpp` is already created
- `Passes.h` defines the interface you need to implement
- Just fill in the methods
- Follow the pattern used in other pass files

### 4. Test Early and Often
- Write tests as you implement
- Test with simple cases first
- Test with edge cases (empty strings, special chars)
- Test integration with PassManager

### 5. Reference the Blueprint
- If stuck, read BLUEPRINT-FROM-GEMINI.md
- If need specs, read TECHNICAL-REQUIREMENTS.md
- If need test ideas, read TESTING-GUIDE.md

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Method not found"
**Solution**: Check `Passes.h` for the base class interface you need to implement.

### Problem: "IR verification failed"
**Solution**: Use `llvm::verifyFunction()` to check your IR modifications are valid.

### Problem: "Don't understand algorithm"
**Solution**: Read BLUEPRINT-FROM-GEMINI.md Section 2 + watch LLVM tutorials.

### Problem: "Test failing"
**Solution**: Review test case in TESTING-GUIDE.md and compare with your implementation.
